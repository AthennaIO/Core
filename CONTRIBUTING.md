# Contributing

Athenna is a community driven project. You are free to contribute in any of the following ways.

- [Coding style](coding-style)
- [Fix bugs by creating PR's](fix-bugs-by-creating-prs)
- [Share an RFC for new features or big changes](share-an-rfc-for-new-features-or-big-changes)
- [Report security issues](report-security-issues)
- [Be a part of the community](be-a-part-of-community)

## Coding style

Majority of Athenna core packages are written in Typescript. Having a brief knowledge of Typescript is required to
contribute to the core.

## Fix bugs by creating PR's

We appreciate every time you report a bug in the packages. However, taking time to submit a PR can help us in fixing
bugs quickly and ensure a healthy and stable ecosystem.

Go through the following points, before creating a new PR.

1. Create an issue discussing the bug or short-coming in the package.
2. Once approved, go ahead and fork the repository.
3. Make sure to start from the `develop`, since this is the upto date branch.
4. Make sure to keep commits small and relevant.
5. We follow [conventional-commits](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog) to structure our
   commit messages. Instead of running `git commit -m "message"`, you must run only `git commit`, which will show you
   prompts to create a valid commit message.
6. Once done with all the changes, create a PR against the `develop` branch.

## Share an RFC for new features or big changes

Sharing PR's for small changes works great. However, when contributing big features to the package, it is required to go
through the RFC process.

### What is an RFC?

RFC stands for **Request for Commits**, a standard process followed by many other frameworks
including [Ember](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs), [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/rfcs)
and [rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs).

In brief, RFC process allows you to talk about the changes with everyone in the community and get a view of the core
team before dedicating your time to work on the feature.

The RFC proposals are created as issues on [AthennaIO/Rfcs](https://github.com/AthennaIO/Rfcs) repository. Make sure to read the
README to learn about the process in depth.

## Report security issues

All the security issues, must be reported via [email](mailto:lenon@athenna.io) and not using any of the public
channels.
