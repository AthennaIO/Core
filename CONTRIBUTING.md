# Contributing

Athenna is a community driven project. You are free to contribute in any of the following ways.

- [Coding style](#coding-style)
- [Fix bugs by creating PR's](#fix-bugs-by-creating-prs)
- [Report security issues](#report-security-issues)

## Coding style

Majority of Athenna core packages are written in modern EcmaScript. Having a brief knowledge of EcmaScript is required to
contribute to the core.

## Fix bugs by creating PR's

We appreciate every time you report a bug in the packages. However, taking time to submit a PR can help us in fixing
bugs quickly and ensure a healthy and stable ecosystem.

Go through the following points, before creating a new PR.

1. Create an issue discussing the bug or short-coming in the package.
2. Once approved, go ahead and fork the repository.
3. Make sure to start from the `develop`, since this is the upto date branch.
4. Make sure to keep commits small and relevant.
5. We follow [conventional-commits](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog) to structure our
   commit messages. Instead of running `git commit -m "message"`, you must run only `git commit`, which will show you
   prompts to create a valid commit message.
6. Once done with all the changes, create a PR against the `develop` branch.

## Report security issues

All the security issues, must be reported via [email](mailto:lenon@athenna.io) and not using any of the public
channels.
